This runs a nozzle with shock at xs = 7. Uses a modified version of the nozzle shape in https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/wind/valid/cdv/cdv.html

Nozzle_fun.m is used to determine the nozzle shape parameters.
Nozzle_shape.m plots nozzle shape and calculates nozzle height at an x location.
Nozzle_yvel.m outlines how the y-velocity is initialized in the nozzle.

To run with a different configuration (different xs, etc) you may need to change M in run.inpt #IC Downstream.
This is the Mach number on the upstream side of the shock. Get this by running the test case with any number
greater than 1 for M, and output the correct M from Compressible/getnewibc::Nozzle Newton iteration loop.
Then re-run with the correct value of M on the upstream side of the shock.
