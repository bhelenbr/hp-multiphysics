This runs Mach 10 viscous flow over a full cylinder.

Process:

1) Run run.inpt until steady state is reached (log2p = 0, shock is stationary).
2) run run_shock.inpt with log2p1 until steady state is reached (shock is now moving).
3) run run_shock.inpt with log2p2 (shock is still moving).
4) Do mesh refinement.

Make sure shock stabilization is turned on for convergence.
